# Flask-LAN-live-chat

hello everyone, 
This is my first proper project over a github repository.
I created a flask chat app that works over a LAN network.

**1. LAN chat**
1. This app is made for communication over LAN only and hence cannot be used for communication in WAN.
2. Make sure to connect all devices to the same network for the above mentioned reason.
